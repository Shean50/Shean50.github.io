I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science department at Virginia Tech, starting in Spring 2023. I hold a Master's degree in Computer Science from the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology (UNIST), which I completed in 2022.

My research area is **Operating Systems, Memory Systems, and Storage Systems**. Within this domain, I specialize in analyzing, redesigning, and implementing the Linux kernel to enhance the efficiency of Memory Systems and Storage Systems. The key research themes I'm recently focusing on include **Memory Compression, Tiered Memory Systems, Compute Express Link (CXL), and LSM Key-Value Store**.
